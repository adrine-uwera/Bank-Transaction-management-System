## Prompt

Dangote has a lot of money. Dangote wants to open a bank. Each client has his own bank account. Each client can deposit money on their account, withdraw money from their account, view their bank balance and transfer money from their account to another client using Dangoteâ€™s bank. Please help Dangote.

## Improvements

He would like to introduce saving accounts and current accounts.

If you deposit money in a current account and the money stays for one month, you get an interest of 1%, but if you have a savings account, the interest is 3% and you can only withdraw after 6 months.
